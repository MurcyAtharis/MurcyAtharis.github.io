			<h1>A quick guide to manual photography: the basics</h1>
			<p><b>Photography is more than a click on the shutter button.</b></p>
			This webpage will provide a brief explanation on the manual mode for your camera.</div>
		<div class = 'div2'>
			<h2 style ="color:black;">What is manual mode and when to use it?</h2>
			<p>While the auto modes calculate the properties through computer when a shot is taken, manual mode for camera allows users’ full control over the adjustment on several attributes, which mainly includes the aperture, shutter speed and ISO.</p>
<p>Comparing these two modes, while the auto modes are good to take quick shots, manual mode is more suitable to take photographs that shows more depth in the photographers’ own aesthetics.</p>

		<p><h3>Aperture</h3></p>
		Aperture refers to how much the diaphragm of the lens will open, influencing the amount of light that will be received by the camera sensor.
<br>The size of the aperture is usually shown as ‘f/*number*’ on the camera. Smaller number refers to larger aperture, hence more light will be entering the camera.
<br>A large aperture will naturally blur the subjects that are out of focus, known as 'shallow depth pf field'.
		<p><h3>Shutter speed</h3></p>
Shutter speed refers to how fast the shutter of the camera will close and open. <br>Faster shutter speed are more capable to capture a ‘still’ moment for subjects that are moving in high speed, where slower shutter speed can make a motion blur effect.
		<p><h3>ISO</h3></p>
The full name of ISO actually refers to the International Organization of Standardization, in whom this property was measured by. <br>The ISO for photography refers to how sensitive the camera will be towards the presence of light.
<br>The higher the ISO was set, the more capability the camera can capture photos with weak light sources. However, the noise in the photos will as well increases as a consequence.
